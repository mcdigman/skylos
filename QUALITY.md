## Good Coding Practice Policy

Skylos treats a "good coding practice" as enforceable only when it meets at least one
of these tests:

1. It is backed by a language, security, quality, or framework standard.
2. It is enforced by a mainstream tool that the ecosystem already accepts.
3. It protects a concrete quality attribute: security, reliability, maintainability,
   performance efficiency, or API correctness.
4. It is an explicit repository policy, such as requiring type-checking, linting,
   pre-commit hooks, or a Skylos gate.

Rules that are only taste preferences should stay out of the default quality set. They
can still be project policy, but they should be configured separately and rolled out as
advisory checks first.
