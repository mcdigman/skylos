## Product Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| Skylos | Local-first static analysis and PR gate for dead code, security, secrets, quality, dependency, and AI-code issues. |
| Local-first | Core static analysis runs on the developer machine or CI runner without requiring cloud upload or LLM calls. |
| Core scan | `skylos .`; dead-code focused scan. |
| Full audit | `skylos . -a`; enables security, secrets, dependency, quality, and AI-defect checks in addition to dead code. |
| Ruff lint integration | `skylos lint`; optional Python-only delegation to `ruff check` with native Ruff configuration, output, fixes, and exit codes. Install with `skylos[lint]`; it is not part of normal Skylos scans. |
| Dead code | Unused functions, classes, imports, variables, parameters, files, unnecessary exports, and unreachable code. |
| Security / danger | Potentially exploitable code paths such as injection, SSRF, path traversal, weak crypto, unsafe deserialization, and CI/CD supply-chain risk. |
| Secrets | Hardcoded credentials, tokens, API keys, and client-side exposure of server-only values. |
| Quality | Maintainability, complexity, architecture, resilience, typing, framework practice, and repo policy issues. |
| AI defects | Evidence-backed AI-code failure modes such as hallucinated APIs, impossible dependencies, phantom references, and weakened tests. Run with `--ai-defects`; full audits include it. Output uses the `ai_defects` bucket; individual findings use category `ai_defect`. |
| AI code mistakes | Hallucinated security calls, phantom decorators, unfinished stubs, disabled controls, placeholder data, stale mocks, and missing timeouts. |
| Security quick | `skylos agent security-quick .`; one-shot LLM security audit, equivalent to `skylos agent scan . --security`. |
| Security deep | `skylos agent security-deep .`; three-stage security workflow for threat-model context, static threat tracing, discovery/validation, and remediation handoff, equivalent to `skylos agent audit . --deep`. |
| Threat trace | Static source-to-sink evidence showing how user-controlled input reaches a sensitive sink, recorded on security-deep findings and run artifacts. |
| Agent verification (pre-deployment) | `skylos defend .`; deterministic static verification of AI-agent guardrails before deployment — tool safety, output validation, prompt-injection exposure, PII filtering, model pinning, and ops checks — scored and gateable in CI. Formerly described as "LLM app defense". Check ids are kebab-case plugin ids (e.g. `no-dangerous-sink`), distinct from the SKY-D260–D267 static rules. |
| LLM integration inventory | `skylos discover .`; maps every LLM call, agent tool, prompt site, input source, and output sink in the codebase — SDK calls, agent frameworks (incl. OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK, Google ADK), MCP servers and their tools, and direct HTTP calls to LLM APIs or OpenAI-compatible gateways. Feeds `skylos defend`. |
| Evidence report | `skylos defend . --format md`; auditor-facing markdown artifact with integration inventory, per-check results, OWASP LLM + Agentic coverage, regulatory framework evidence, remediation appendix, and attestation. |
| Attestation digest | Reproducible SHA-256 over scanned file contents, policy hash, plugin set, OWASP selection, filters, integration inventory, scores, and full check evidence; emitted in defend JSON/md/SARIF output. Identical trees, flags, policy, plugin set, and Skylos version reproduce identical digests; timestamps are excluded. |
| Framework evidence | Defend check results mapped to EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and ISO/IEC 42001 controls with strict "evidence toward" semantics — never a compliance determination. |
| Prompt templates | Maintainer-provided files under `[tool.skylos.templates]` that extend built-in LLM prompts without replacing safety and JSON-output contracts. |
| Vibe dictionary | Project-specific keyword extensions under `[tool.skylos.vibe]` for phantom security names, credential names, sensitive files, and timeout-required calls. |
| Quality gate | A threshold-based pass/fail decision used locally or in CI. |
| Diff-aware scan | `--diff <base>` limits reporting to changed work so old debt does not drown out the current PR. |
| Baseline | A saved set of accepted existing findings so only new or changed findings fail a gate. |
| Suppression | An inline or config-level exception for an intentional finding, usually using `skylos: ignore[SKY-...]`. |
| Smart tracing | `--trace`; runtime-assisted dead-code verification used to reduce false positives in dynamic Python code. |
| Technical debt | `skylos debt .`; ranks maintainability hotspots and debt trends. |
| TUI | `--tui`; screen-only selectable terminal interface with category list, finding list, and detail pane. |
| Pretty output | `--format pretty`; compact file-grouped terminal output with severity rails, snippets, and copyable `file:line` locations. |
| Concise output | `--format concise`; untruncated `file:line  RULE_ID  message` output for editors, scripts, and agents. |
| Rule selection | `--select SKY-...`; exact, case-insensitive rule filtering across scan output formats with automatic analyzer-family enablement. |
| Structured output | `--format json`, `--format llm`, or `--format github` for machines, LLM consumers, and GitHub annotations. |
| Upload / Cloud workflow | Optional upload of scan results to Skylos Cloud; not required for local analysis. |
| MCP server | Integration surface for AI agents and coding assistants. |
| SCA | Software composition analysis for dependency vulnerability findings. |
| Symlink safety | Checks for file operations that follow repository-controlled symbolic links across the intended scan or output boundary. |

## Kubernetes Deployment Exposure (SKY-DEP)

Skylos correlates resources in one rendered multi-document Kubernetes file.
The scan is deliberately opt-in: the `Ingress` must declare
`skylos.dev/network-scope: external` (or `public`) and
`skylos.dev/backend-protocol: http`. Skylos then emits a finding only when it
can construct one unambiguous static chain inside that same file:

```text
annotated Ingress path -> Service port -> selected workload -> one container
-> matching target port -> bare Flask/Uvicorn/Gunicorn executable, target, and binding
```

For `SKY-DEP001`, the workload Pod template also supplies the route contract:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    skylos.dev/source-file: app/main.py
    skylos.dev/required-guards: require_admin, require_employee
```

`skylos.dev/source-file` is a repository-relative Python file that must match
the server's literal module target. `skylos.dev/required-guards` is a
comma-separated list of guard names. Skylos checks direct, top-level literal
routes on the resolved FastAPI or Flask application symbol. A route is reported
only when its Ingress-reachable path contains a sensitive segment such as
`admin`, `internal`, `debug`, `manage`, `metrics`, or `pprof` and one or more
declared guards are missing. Recognized guard locations are application or
route dependencies, handler dependency parameters, and handler decorators.
Guard names match the declared expression identity exactly; for example,
`auth.require_admin` does not match `other.require_admin`. Sensitive route
names do not bypass an explicit required-guards contract.

`SKY-DEP002` is narrower: it reports an effective Flask debugger enabled by
literal `--debug` / `--no-debug` and `--debugger` / `--no-debugger` precedence on
the resolved externally routed container. `SKY-DEP003` separately reports a
literal `--reload` flag on a resolved Flask, Uvicorn, or Gunicorn container, or
Flask debug mode when it implies reload and `--no-reload` is absent.
These two command checks do not require the source-file or required-guards
annotations. All three rules require a literal `0.0.0.0` or `::` server bind,
numeric server port, and a Service target port that reaches that binding.
Backend transport evidence must be explicitly plain HTTP; HTTPS, H2, gRPC,
passthrough, controller TLS/path rewrites, snippets, middleware chains, and
other unproved protocols make the scanner abstain. An Ingress
`defaultBackend` is correlated only when the Ingress has no explicit rules,
because explicit paths take precedence before the default backend.

The scanner abstains when a proof edge is missing, dynamic, invalid, or
non-unique. Scope, backend-protocol, source-file, and required-guards
annotations are repository-owned declarations, and emitted evidence remains a candidate
correlated-static proof. Skylos verifies exact framework wiring, not the
guard implementation's semantics. The source annotation also does not prove
that the analyzed file was built into the referenced container image, and a
literal executable name does not attest the server binary's provenance inside
the image. Direct route ordering and obvious route-graph mutation are checked;
ambiguous router composition makes the scanner abstain. It does not join
resources split across different files, inspect nested routers or
factory-registered routes for `SKY-DEP001`, render Helm or Kustomize, execute a
manifest, query a cluster, or infer live network policy. Direct `LoadBalancer`
and `NodePort` Services without an annotated Ingress are outside this rule
family. Kubernetes `List` wrappers and resources whose metadata cannot be
positioned precisely are also outside the proof surface. For security gates,
keep the annotations in protected deployment
policy because removing an opt-in contract makes this rule family abstain.

| ID | Severity | Category | Name | Correlated static evidence |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| SKY-DEP001 | HIGH | Security | Externally deployed route is missing a required auth guard | Annotated Ingress, Service, workload/container, explicit entrypoint, contracted source, direct FastAPI/Flask route, and exact required guard |
| SKY-DEP002 | HIGH | Security | External Ingress exposes the Flask development debugger | Annotated Ingress, Service, workload/container, matching Flask binding, and an effective literal debugger flag |
| SKY-DEP003 | MEDIUM | Reliability | External Ingress routes to a reload-mode application server | Annotated Ingress, Service, workload/container, matching Flask/Uvicorn/Gunicorn binding, and a literal flag that effectively enables reload |

## GPU Release Compatibility (SKY-GPU)

Skylos treats `.skylos/gpu-targets.yml` version 1 as the repository's explicit
deployment truth. A target declares the NVIDIA driver, CUDA compute capability,
and platform that a release must support:

```yaml
version: 1
targets:
  - name: inference-t4
    vendor: nvidia
    driver: "535.104.05"
    compute_capability: "7.5"
    platform: linux/amd64
```

These rules statically cross-check that target profile against Docker image,
CUDA build, and TensorRT packaging evidence before release. They do not probe
installed hardware or drivers, and they do not perform package CVE analysis.
All targets in one profile are treated as recipients of the same release;
repositories with separate per-device artifacts should scan each deployable
with its own target contract.

The contract is fail-closed once present: malformed YAML, duplicate or unknown
keys, empty targets, invalid driver values, deletion in a changed-file scan,
unsupported platform values, and bounded evidence discovery that cannot finish
emit `SKY-GPU000`. Platforms are limited to `linux` or `windows`, optionally
with `/amd64` or `/arm64`. The
default quality gate allows zero Reliability findings, so a proved GPU release
break blocks `--gate` without requiring `--strict`.

Explicitly selecting any `SKY-GPU` rule opts the scan into this contract: a
missing profile emits `SKY-GPU000`, and selecting `SKY-GPU001`, `SKY-GPU002`,
or `SKY-GPU003` automatically retains that prerequisite finding. This prevents
a narrow `--select ... --gate` command from hiding an invalid or absent
contract and passing open.

`SKY-GPU001` evaluates the effective final Docker stage, including its resolved
stage-alias ancestry, when it is an NVIDIA CUDA image
and compares the declared target driver with NVIDIA's CUDA-major
minor-compatibility branch floor. Windows targets use the Windows branch floor;
an omitted platform defaults to Linux. Skylos deliberately does not treat a
`cuda-compat-*` token as a waiver: NVIDIA forward compatibility also depends on
the exact package/driver matrix, loader configuration, supported GPU class, and
feature use. Teams relying on that path must document an explicit inline rule
waiver at the CUDA `FROM` instruction.

`SKY-GPU002` models output kind and direction: unsuffixed CMake architectures
produce both real SASS and virtual PTX, `-real` and `-virtual` are distinct, and
PTX covers only equal-or-newer compute capabilities. A cubin covers compatible
devices in its compute-capability major family. An actual `nvcc -arch=sm_*`
command proves both cubin and PTX output; quoted examples and `echo` text do not
count as build evidence. Dynamic/conditional values, `native`, target-level
overrides, or multiple independent architecture evidence files produce
`SKY-GPU000` rather than a confident compatibility result.

`SKY-GPU003` ties a syntactically valid Python TensorRT build call to the exact
config object, a later binary write of that result, an exact repository-relative
engine path, and a `COPY`/`ADD` in the final Docker stage. C++ matching requires
`NvInfer.h` and ordered builder/config/output evidence. `AMPERE_PLUS` counts only
when applied to that config before serialization; it does not imply portability
across different operating-system/CPU platforms.

| ID | Severity | Name | Cross-file evidence |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| SKY-GPU000 | HIGH | GPU release contract is invalid or incomplete | Contract schema/deletion or bounded evidence proof could not complete |
| SKY-GPU001 | HIGH | CUDA image requires newer NVIDIA driver | CUDA container image and declared target driver |
| SKY-GPU002 | HIGH | CUDA target architecture missing from build | CUDA architecture flags and declared compute capability |
| SKY-GPU003 | HIGH | TensorRT engine is not portable across target GPUs | Serialized engine packaging, compatibility flags, and heterogeneous target GPUs |

## Secrets (SKY-S)

| ID | Severity | Name | Languages / Scope | CWE |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| S101 | CRITICAL | Hardcoded secret / API key | Python, TS/JS, Java, Go, config files | CWE-798 |
| S102 | HIGH* | Secret material or server-only environment variable exposed to client-accessible code | TS/JS, HTML, client bundles | CWE-200 |

`SKY-S102` preserves `CRITICAL` severity when it reclassifies a concrete
hardcoded credential from `SKY-S101`; environment-reference exposure is `HIGH`.

## Security Contracts (SKY-SC)

| ID | Severity | Name | Scope |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| SC001 | HIGH | Security contract regression | Diff-aware CI/CD review |

## AI Defects

AI-defect grouping is based on finding category, not only the rule-ID prefix.
The CLI flag is `--ai-defects`, JSON reports use the top-level `ai_defects`
bucket, and individual findings use category `ai_defect`. Some hallucination
rules keep historical `SKY-L` or `SKY-D` IDs for compatibility with existing
suppressions, baselines, CI policies, and docs links; new AI-defect-only rules
use the `SKY-A` prefix.

## Dead Code and Reachability

| ID | Severity | Name | Scope |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| U001 | INFO | Unused function | Upload/API normalized dead-code category |
| U002 | INFO | Unused import | Upload/API normalized dead-code category |
| U003 | INFO | Unused variable | Upload/API normalized dead-code category |
| U004 | INFO | Unused class | Upload/API normalized dead-code category |
| U005 | MEDIUM | Declared dependency appears unused | Python dependencies |
| U006 | INFO | Unused parameter | Debt normalized dead-code category |
| DC001 | MEDIUM | Unused function | LLM report dead-code ID |
| DC002 | LOW | Unused import | LLM report dead-code ID |
| DC003 | MEDIUM | Unused class | LLM report dead-code ID |
| DC004 | LOW | Unused variable | LLM report dead-code ID |
| DC005 | LOW | Unused parameter | LLM report dead-code ID |
| DC006 | LOW | Empty or unused file | LLM report dead-code ID |
| UC001 | MEDIUM | Unreachable code after control-flow exit | Python |
| UC002 | MEDIUM | Unreachable code after return/throw/break/continue | TS/JS, Java |

Pretty output and the TUI use short display labels such as
`dead-code/function`, `dead-code/import`, `dead-code/class`,
`dead-code/variable`, `dead-code/parameter`, and `dead-code/file`. Those labels
are UI grouping text, not stable rule IDs; use the `SKY-*` IDs above for
suppression, integrations, and public references.

## Dependency Vulnerabilities

| ID | Severity | Name | Scope |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| SCA-* | varies | Software composition analysis vulnerability | Dependency manifests / installed packages |

## Aggregate, Alias, and Workflow IDs

These IDs appear in API normalization, audit workflows, LLM schemas, prompts, or
agent workflows. They are not always emitted as first-class static-analysis
findings.

| ID | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| SKY-D000 | Generic security fallback ID for normalized external findings. |
| SKY-Q000 | Generic quality fallback ID for normalized external findings. |
| SKY-S000 | Generic secret fallback ID for normalized external findings. |
| SKY-SCA-000 | Generic dependency fallback ID for normalized external findings. |
| SKY-U000 | Generic dead-code fallback ID for agent workflows. |
| SKY-D101 | Legacy compliance alias for code injection. |
| SKY-D102 | Legacy compliance alias for code injection. |
| SKY-D103 | Legacy compliance alias for insecure deserialization. |
| SKY-AUDIT | Deep-audit candidate or artifact marker. |
| SKY-AUDIT-ENTRYPOINT | Deep-audit entrypoint candidate marker. |
| SKY-AUDIT-LOGIC | Deep-audit repository investigation logic finding. |
| SKY-AUDIT-PATH | Deep-audit security-sensitive path candidate marker. |
| SKY-AUDIT-SECURITY | Deep-audit repository investigation security finding. |
| SKY-DEAD | LLM dead-code verifier marker. |
| SKY-DEAD-CHALLENGE | LLM dead-code challenge marker. |
| SKY-DEBT | Agent command-center debt marker. |
| SKY-FIX | Agent remediation / fix generation marker. |
| SKY-L000 | Generic logic fallback ID for LLM schemas. |
| SKY-C399 | Structure placeholder ID used in prompt examples. |
| SKY-Q499 | Quality placeholder ID used in prompt examples. |
| SKY-P499 | Performance placeholder ID used in prompt examples. |
| SKY-S199 | Secret placeholder ID used in prompt examples. |

Prompt text may also use range notation such as `SKY-D226-228`,
`SKY-L001-004`, or `SKY-P401-404` to describe groups of concrete rule IDs.

## Custom Rules

Custom rule packs may emit project-defined IDs from `.skylos/rules/*.yml`.
Prefer a stable project prefix, for example `ORG-SEC001`, to avoid colliding
with Skylos-owned `SKY-*` IDs.
